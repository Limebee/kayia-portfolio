# How It's Made
Tech Used: Next.js, React, Tailwind
This application was made with the framework Next.js and React. Tailwind was used for the styling.
# Optimizations
I would like to improve the loading of the pages. I want to add animations to the photos as they load on the page. When the photos are clicked I want a like a lightbox to show a bigger version of the photo.

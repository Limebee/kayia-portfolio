# How It's Made
Tech Used: Next.js, React, Tailwind
This application was made with the framework Next.js and React. Tailwind was used for the styling.
# Optimizations
I would like to improve the loading of the pages. I want to add animations to the photos as they load on the page. When the photos are clicked I want a like a lightbox to show a bigger version of the photo.
# Lessons Learned
Working on this project helped me learn how to work with new technology I wasn't familar with. I knew some the basics of React before doing this project. It helped me put what I learned in in practice. Also, I learn more aout Next.js. It was a framework that I wasn't familiar with before doing this project. It allowed me to get more comfortable with it.
